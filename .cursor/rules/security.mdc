NEVER log sensitive data (tokens, passwords, personal information).

Mobile (React Native):
- Use Keychain for tokens and credentials
- AsyncStorage only for non-sensitive data
- Always use HTTPS for API communications
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs

Backend (Express.js):
- Use bcrypt with 12 salt rounds for passwords
- Implement rate limiting on public endpoints (5 req/min for login)
- Always use prepared statements in SQL ($1, $2, ...), never concatenate strings
- Use structured error responses: { code, message, issues? }
- Never expose internal error details in production

Environment variables:
- Mobile: Use EXPO_PUBLIC_* for public vars, never expose secrets
- Backend: Use .env for secrets, never commit to git
