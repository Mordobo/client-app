Respect the mobile project structure:
- app/ for Expo Router routes
- components/ for reusable UI components
- services/ for API client services (consuming APIs from backend)
- utils/ for utility functions
- hooks/ for custom hooks
- contexts/ for React Contexts
- i18n/ for internationalization

IMPORTANT: Backend APIs are in a SEPARATE repository at /Users/angelorivas/Desktop/Proyectos_Personales/Mordobo/API
- Do NOT create API endpoints in mobile/services/
- mobile/services/ contains CLIENT code that calls the backend APIs
- Backend API endpoints belong in Mordobo/API/src/routes/
Place files in the correct folders according to their purpose.
