For backend API (Mordobo/API repository):Structure:
- API/src/routes/ for API endpoints organized by domain
- API/src/db.ts for database connection
- API/src/index.ts for Express server setupConventions:
- Always use prepared statements in SQL ($1, $2, ...), never concatenate strings
- Validate all inputs with Zod before processing
- Use structured error responses: { code, message, issues? }
- Implement rate limiting on public endpoints
- Use connection pooling, don't create new connections per request

When working on backend:
- Verify you're in Mordobo/API directory
- Endpoints go in src/routes/
- Database queries use pg pool with prepared statements
- Document endpoints in BRUNO_API_DOCUMENTATION.md
