Always implement comprehensive error handling:

Mobile:
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Implement error boundaries for React components
- Handle loading and error states gracefully in UI
- Show user-friendly error messages using i18nBackend:
- Use structured error format: { code, message, issues? }
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 401, 404, 409, 500)
- Use descriptive error codes: validation_error, invalid_credentials, email_taken
- Never expose internal error details in production
- Log errors server-side but don't include sensitive dataAlways handle errors from the start, not as an afterthought.
