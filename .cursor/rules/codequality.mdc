Write clean, readable, self-documenting code:

- Use functional components with hooks (never class components)
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use StyleSheet.create for styles (not inline objects for performance)
- Include error handling from the start, not as an afterthought
- Add comments only when code isn't self-explanatory
- Follow naming conventions: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions

Mobile specific:
- Use React.memo for components that receive stable props
- Prefer useCallback for functions passed as props
- Use useMemo for expensive computations

Backend specific:
- Keep route handlers focused and single-purpose
- Extract business logic to service functions when complex
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns (auth, validation, logging)
