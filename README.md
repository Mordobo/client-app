# client-app

Mobile app for Mordobo clients to browse, book, and manage home services. Built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and React Native.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the `app` directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Resetting the Starter Code

When you're ready for a clean slate, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command moves the starter code to the `app-example` directory and creates a blank `app` directory where you can begin developing.
